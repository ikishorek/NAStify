# Windows Example App

Visual Studio 2010 solution with the MEGA C++ SDK and a simple console app using the intermediate layer (`include/megaapi.h`).

The example logs in to your MEGA account, gets your MEGA filesystem, shows the files/folders in your root folder and uploads an image.

## How to run the project

1. Download the SDK or clone the SDK repository
2. Download the prebuilt third party dependencies from this link:
https://mega.co.nz/#!IttCER5A!0EhXmR6eyVSDDqXFm0hD_wHbGEKM32bJSPKeEmi7n90

3. Extract and put the 3rdparty folder in `examples/win32/`.
4. Open `examples/win32/MEGA.sln` with Visual Studio 2010 or a posterior version of Visual Studio for Windows Desktop.
5. Make sure that the `testmega` project is selected as init or main project
6. Put the email/password of your MEGA account at the top of `main.cpp` in the `testmega` project
7. Build and run the application

## Notes

Third party dependencies have been built with Visual Studio 2010 SP1, so you will need the Visual C++ 2010 SP1 Redistributable Package to run applications linked to these libraries. It is installed along with Visual Studio, but you can also download it here: <br />

All these dependencies have been build using the original source code without any modification. You can build them by yourself by downloading them from their homepages:

- Crypto++ (used to encryption/decryption):

- FreeImage (used to manage thumbnails/previews):
http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/

- Zlib (used to compress/uncompress network communications):
http://www.zlib.net/

- SQLite (used to manage the local cache of the MEGA filesystem):
http://www.sqlite.org/

- libsodium (almost not used for now, will be used by the upcoming chat/messaging features)
http://libsodium.org

- PCRE (not used for now, will be used by the upcoming advanced exclusion lists for the synchronization engine)
